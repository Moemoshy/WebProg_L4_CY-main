<!--### One-page website :ballot_box_with_check:

Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

* An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find. 
* A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
* A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked. 
* Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
* At least two classes. 
* One link styled as a button.

### Multi-page website (Bonus - Optional)

Using the one-page website you created, clone it into a new directory and split the information down into a simple multi-page website.

* An individual page for: plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find. 
* Put your new pages in a subdirectory called "pages".
* Ensure that each page has a navigation bar.

        <blockquote>
            <p>The Truman Show’s new 4K/Dolby Vision presentation offers a solid improvement over Paramount’s 2008 Blu-ray, 
                which offered a decent transfer that was marred by too much DNR. The new 4K disc eliminates that problem, offering a 
                presentation that is much more nuanced and film-like, with fine detail that accentuates the smooth textures of Seahaven’s 
                constructed surfaces (as well as the ostentatious tweed suits that Truman wears) despite the film’s unnaturally bright 
                lighting. The improved detail does work to the film’ detriment in its one major special effects shot, however, which reveals 
                the Seahaven studio as an all-too-obvious matte painting. The color also appears to be more intense, with an emphasis on the 
                deeply saturated primary colors that are so crucial to the film’s slightly unreal quality. Dark scene also fare very well, 
                with strong blacks and good shadow detail. (A quick note on the aspect ratio: The transfer is matted at 1.85:1, the aspect 
                ratio used on the 2005 Special Collector’s Edition DVD. The 2008 Blu-ray was matted at 1.78:1, while the original 1998 DVD 
                transfer was matted at 1.66:1. I believe that Peter Weir intended it to be projected at 1.66:1 to more closely mimic a 
                cathode ray television screen’s dimensions, but most—if not all—U.S. theaters projected it at 1.85:1, as is their custom 
                for films shot flat.) The 4K disc also upgrades the soundtrack from Dolby Digital TrueHD 5.1 to Dolby Atmos, which has great 
                depth and surround activity and also really shows off Burkhard Dallwitz’s musical score. The storm-at-sea sequence near the 
                end of the film is particularly enveloping, with a good use of the low end and surrounds.

            Unfortunately, despite being billed as a “25th Anniversary Edition,” there are no new supplements on the 4K disc. Instead, all 
            the extras are the same as were found on the 2008 Blu-Ray disc and the 2005 Special Collector’s Edition DVD. The two-part making-of 
            documentary How’s It Going to End? The Making of The Truman Show covers all the major aspects of the film’s production, from the 
            lengthy screenwriting period in which director Peter Weir had writer Andrew Niccol change quite a few things, to scouting locations, 
            to the actual shooting. Put together, the two parts of the doc run roughly 40 minutes, although it’s not entirely clear why it was 
            split up (to some extent, the first half tends to deal more with the ideas behind the film, whereas the second part deals more with 
            the nuts and bolts of production). Interviews include Weir, producer Edward S. Feldman, and stars Laura Linney, Ed Harris, and Noah \
            Emmerich. Carrey only appears in circa-1998 interviews, but Niccol is completely MIA. The film’s effectively subtle visual effects 
            are covered in the 13-minute featurette “Faux Finishing: The Visual Effects of The Truman Show,” which includes interviews with 
            several members of the visual effects crew. The disc is rounded out with four deleted scenes, a thorough photo gallery of production 
            pics, a pair of trailers, and a pair of TV spots.</p>
